# Project--Javascript-Text-Based-Rpg
I am looking to join together a team of programmers to create a text based RPG in Javascript. 
The setting would be something like Skyrim.  You would control a character and complete multiple quests and such. 
This is a game I would like to put alot of time into enough to be able to put it on market.  If you're interested just leave me a reply.
